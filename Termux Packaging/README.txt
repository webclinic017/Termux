# Termux packaging tools
This project contains packaging tools for Termux written in Rust.

*NOTE*: This is my first Rust code, so suggestions for improvements are very welcome!

*NOTE*: These are newly created tools not yet tested.

*NOTE*: There also [shell script](./scripts/generate-bootstraps.sh) utility for generating bootstrap archives.
