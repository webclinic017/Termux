       npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts
       modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
       conflicts intelligently.

       It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.
       Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop
       node programs.

       npm is configured to use npm, Inc.'s public registry at
       https://registry.npmjs.org by default. Use of the npm public registry
       is subject to terms of use available at
       https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms.

       You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even
       run your own registry. Use of someone else's registry may be governed
       by their terms of use.

       You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

       Use nnppmm iinnssttaallll bblleerrgg to install the latest version of "blerg".  Check
       out npm help iinnssttaallll for more info.  It can do a lot of stuff.

       Use the nnppmm sseeaarrcchh command to show everything that's available.  Use
       nnppmm llss to show everything you've installed.

       If a package references to another package with a git URL, npm depends
       on a preinstalled git.

       If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and
       requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use node-gyp
       _h_t_t_p_s_:_/_/_g_i_t_h_u_b_._c_o_m_/_n_o_d_e_j_s_/_n_o_d_e_-_g_y_p for that task.  For a Unix system,
       node-gyp _h_t_t_p_s_:_/_/_g_i_t_h_u_b_._c_o_m_/_n_o_d_e_j_s_/_n_o_d_e_-_g_y_p needs Python, make and a
       buildchain like GCC. On Windows, Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++
       are needed.  For more information visit the node-gyp repository

       See npm help ffoollddeerrss to learn about where npm puts stuff.

       In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

       +o global mode: npm installs packages into the install prefix at
         pprreeffiixx//lliibb//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess and bins are installed in pprreeffiixx//bbiinn.

       +o local mode: npm installs packages into the current project directory,
         which defaults to the current working directory.  Packages are
         installed to ..//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess, and bins are installed to
         ..//nnooddee__mmoodduulleess//..bbiinn.


       Local mode is the default.  Use --gg or ----gglloobbaall on any command to
       operate in global mode instead.

       If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the
       following help topics:

       +o json: Make a package.json file.  See npm help ppaacckkaaggee..jjssoonn.

       +o link: For linking your current working code into Node's path, so that
         you don't have to reinstall every time you make a change.  Use nnppmm
         lliinnkk to do this.

       +o install: It's a good idea to install things if you don't need the
         symbolic link.  Especially, installing other peoples code from the
         registry is done via nnppmm iinnssttaallll

       +o adduser: Create an account or log in.  Credentials are stored in the
         user config file.

       +o publish: Use the nnppmm ppuubblliisshh command to upload your code to the
         registry.

       npm is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options from
       5 places.

       +o Command line switches: Set a config with ----kkeeyy vvaall.  All keys take a
         value, even if they are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what
         the options are at the time of parsing).  If no value is provided,
         then the option is set to boolean ttrruuee.

       +o Environment Variables: Set any config by prefixing the name in an
         environment variable with nnppmm__ccoonnffiigg__.  For example, eexxppoorrtt
         nnppmm__ccoonnffiigg__kkeeyy==vvaall.

       +o User Configs: The file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of
         configs.  If present, it is parsed.  If the uusseerrccoonnffiigg option is set
         in the cli or env, then that will be used instead.

       +o Global Configs: The file found at ../etc/npmrc (from the node
         executable, by default this resolves to /usr/local/etc/npmrc) will be
         parsed if it is found.  If the gglloobbaallccoonnffiigg option is set in the cli,
         env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead.

       +o Defaults: npm's default configuration options are defined in
         lib/utils/config-defs.js.  These must not be changed.


       See npm help ccoonnffiigg for much much more information.
