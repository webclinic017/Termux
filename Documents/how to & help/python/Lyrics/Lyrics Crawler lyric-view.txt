Do You Know Where Your Children Are (Original Version) by Michael Jackson

[Verse 1]
Father comes home from work, and he is scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Verse 2]
She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothing to eat

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Bridge]
Save me (from this living hell)
Save me (cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me (cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me (cause I'm out for blood)
Save me (cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (it's time I replied)
Save me
Save me

[Verse 3]
Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she want to be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He is taking her on the streets, off Sunset Boulevard
She is selling her body hot, girl that will take you far
The police come around the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
