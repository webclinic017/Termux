Installation Guide
==================

.. note::

    If you wish to contribute to the project, it's recommended you
    :ref:`install the latest development version<install_from_source>`.

Installing an official release
==============================

Matplotlib and its dependencies are available as wheel packages for macOS,
Windows and Linux distributions::

  python -m pip install -U pip
  python -m pip install -U matplotlib

If this command results in Matplotlib being compiled from source and
there's trouble with the compilation, you can add ``--prefer-binary`` to
select the newest version of Matplotlib for which there is a
precompiled wheel for your OS and Python.

.. note::

   The following backends work out of the box: Agg, ps, pdf, svg

   Python is typically shipped with tk bindings which are used by
   TkAgg.

   For support of other GUI frameworks, LaTeX rendering, saving
   animations and a larger selection of file formats, you need to
   install :ref:`additional dependencies <install_requirements>`.

Although not required, we suggest also installing ``IPython`` for
interactive use.  To easily install a complete Scientific Python
stack, see :ref:`install_scipy_dists` below.

Test data
---------

The wheels (:file:`*.whl`) on the `PyPI download page
<https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>`_ do not contain test data
or example code.

If you want to try the many demos that come in the Matplotlib source
distribution, download the :file:`*.tar.gz` file and look in the
:file:`examples` subdirectory.

To run the test suite:

* extract the :file:`lib/matplotlib/tests` or :file:`lib/mpl_toolkits/tests`
  directories from the source distribution.
* install test dependencies: `pytest <https://pypi.org/project/pytest>`_,
  MiKTeX, GhostScript, ffmpeg, avconv, ImageMagick, and `Inkscape
  <https://inkscape.org/>`_.
* run ``python -mpytest``.

Third-party distributions of Matplotlib
=======================================

.. _install_scipy_dists:

Scientific Python Distributions
-------------------------------

`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ and `ActiveState
<https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_ are excellent
choices that "just work" out of the box for Windows, macOS and common
Linux platforms. `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_ is an
option for Windows users.  All of these distributions include
Matplotlib and *lots* of other useful (data) science tools.

Linux: using your package manager
---------------------------------

If you are on Linux, you might prefer to use your package manager.  Matplotlib
is packaged for almost every major Linux distribution.

* Debian / Ubuntu: ``sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib``
* Fedora: ``sudo dnf install python3-matplotlib``
* Red Hat: ``sudo yum install python3-matplotlib``
* Arch: ``sudo pacman -S python-matplotlib``

.. _install_from_source:

Installing from source
======================

If you are interested in contributing to Matplotlib development,
running the latest source code, or just like to build everything
yourself, it is not difficult to build Matplotlib from source.

The easiest way to get the latest development version to start contributing
is to go to the git `repository <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_
and run::

  git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git

If you're developing, it's better to do it in editable mode. The reason why
is that pytest's test discovery only works for Matplotlib
if installation is done this way. Also, editable mode allows your code changes
to be instantly propagated to your library code without reinstalling (though
you will have to restart your python process / kernel)::

  python -m pip install -e .

If you're not developing, it can be installed from the source directory with
a simple::

  python -m pip install .

To run the tests you will need to install some additional dependencies::

  python -m pip install -r requirements/dev/dev-requirements.txt

.. warning::

  The following instructions in this section are for very custom
  installations of Matplotlib. Proceed with caution because these instructions
  may result in your build producing unexpected behavior and/or causing
  local testing to fail.

If you would like to build from a tarball, grab the latest *tar.gz* release
file from `the PyPI files page <https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>`_.

We provide a `setup.cfg`_ file which you can use to customize the build
process. For example, which default backend to use, whether some of the
optional libraries that Matplotlib ships with are installed, and so on.  This
file will be particularly useful to those packaging Matplotlib.

.. _install_requirements:

Dependencies
------------

Matplotlib will automatically install dependencies when you install with
``pip``, so this section is mostly for your reference.

Matplotlib requires the following dependencies:

* `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ (>= 3.7)
* `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ (>= 1.16)
* `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* `cycler <https://matplotlib.org/cycler/>`_ (>= 0.10.0)
* `dateutil <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil>`_ (>= 2.7)
* `kiwisolver <https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi>`_ (>= 1.0.1)
* `Pillow <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (>= 6.2)
* `pyparsing <https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/>`_ (>=2.2.1)

Optionally, you can also install a number of packages to enable better user
interface toolkits. See :ref:`what-is-a-backend` for more details on the
optional Matplotlib backends and the capabilities they provide.

* Tk_ (>= 8.3, != 8.6.0 or 8.6.1): for the Tk-based backends.
* PyQt4_ (>= 4.6) or PySide_ (>= 1.0.3) [#]_: for the Qt4-based backends.
* PyQt5_ or PySide2_: for the Qt5-based backends.
* PyGObject_: for the GTK3-based backends [#]_.
* wxPython_ (>= 4) [#]_: for the wx-based backends.
* pycairo_ (>= 1.11.0) or cairocffi_ (>= 0.8): for the GTK3 and/or cairo-based
  backends.
* Tornado_: for the WebAgg backend.

.. [#] PySide cannot be pip-installed on Linux (but can be conda-installed).
.. [#] If using pip (and not conda), PyGObject must be built from source; see
       https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devguide/dev_environ.html.
.. [#] If using pip (and not conda) on Linux, wxPython wheels must be manually
       downloaded from https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/.

For better support of animation output format and image file formats, LaTeX,
etc., you can install the following:

* `ffmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_: for saving movies.
* `ImageMagick <https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>`_: for saving
  animated gifs.
* `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ (with `cm-super
  <https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-super>`__ ) and `GhostScript (>=9.0)
  <https://ghostscript.com/download/>`_ : for rendering text with
  LaTeX.
* `fontconfig <https://www.fontconfig.org>`_ (>= 2.7): for detection of system
  fonts on Linux.

FreeType and Qhull
------------------

Matplotlib depends on `FreeType <https://www.freetype.org/>`_ (>=
2.3), a font rendering library, and on `Qhull
<http://www.qhull.org/>`_ (>= 2015.2), a library for computing
triangulations.  By default (except on AIX) Matplotlib downloads and
builds its own copy of FreeType (this is necessary to run the test
suite, because different versions of FreeType rasterize characters
differently), and uses its own copy of Qhull.

To force Matplotlib to use a copy of FreeType or Qhull already installed in
your system, create a :file:`setup.cfg` file with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [libs]
   system_freetype = true
   system_qhull = true

before running ``python -m pip install .``.

In this case, you need to install the FreeType and Qhull library and headers.
This can be achieved using a package manager, e.g. for FreeType:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Pick ONE of the following:
   sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev  # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install freetype-devel  # Fedora
   brew install freetype  # macOS with Homebrew
   conda install freetype  # conda, any OS

(adapt accordingly for Qhull).

On Linux and macOS, it is also recommended to install pkg-config_, a helper
tool for locating FreeType:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Pick ONE of the following:
   sudo apt install pkg-config  # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install pkgconf  # Fedora
   brew install pkg-config  # macOS with Homebrew
   conda install pkg-config  # conda
   # Or point the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the path to pkg-config:
   export PKG_CONFIG=...

.. _pkg-config: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/

If not using pkg-config (in particular on Windows), you may need to set the
include path (to the library headers) and link path (to the libraries)
explicitly, if they are not in standard locations.  This can be done using
standard environment variables -- on Linux and OSX:

.. code-block:: sh

   export CFLAGS='-I/directory/containing/ft2build.h'
   export LDFLAGS='-L/directory/containing/libfreetype.so'

and on Windows:

.. code-block:: bat

   set CL=/IC:\directory\containing\ft2build.h
   set LINK=/LIBPATH:C:\directory\containing\freetype.lib

.. note::

  Matplotlib always uses its own copies of the following libraries:

  - ``Agg``: the Anti-Grain Geometry C++ rendering engine;
  - ``ttconv``: a TrueType font utility.

If you go this route but need to reset and rebuild to change your settings,
remember to clear your artifacts before re-building::

  git clean -xfd

Building on Windows
-------------------

Compiling Matplotlib (or any other extension module, for that matter) requires
Visual Studio 2015 or later.

If you are building your own Matplotlib wheels (or sdists), note that any DLLs
that you copy into the source tree will be packaged too.

Conda packages
--------------

The conda packaging scripts for Matplotlib are available at
https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock.
