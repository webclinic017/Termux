Embedding Matplotlib in graphical user interfaces
=================================================

You can embed Matplotlib directly into a user interface application by
following the embedding_in_SOMEGUI.py examples here. Currently
matplotlib supports wxpython, pygtk, tkinter and pyqt4/5.

When embedding Matplotlib in a GUI, you must use the Matplotlib API
directly rather than the pylab/pyplot proceedural interface, so take a
look at the examples/api directory for some example code working with
the API.
