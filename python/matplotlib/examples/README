Matplotlib examples
===================

There are a variety of ways to use Matplotlib, and most of them are
illustrated in the examples in this directory.

Probably the most common way people use Matplotlib is with the
procedural interface, which follows the MATLAB/IDL/Mathematica approach
of using simple procedures like "plot" or "title" to modify the current
figure.  These examples are included in the "pylab_examples" directory.
If you want to write more robust scripts, e.g., for production use or in
a web application server, you will probably want to use the Matplotlib
API for full control.  These examples are found in the "api" directory.
Below is a brief description of the different directories found here:

  * animation - Dynamic plots, see the documentation at
    http://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html

  * axes_grid1 - Examples related to the axes_grid1 toolkit.

  * axisartist - Examples related to the axisartist toolkit.

  * event_handling - How to interact with your figure, mouse presses,
    key presses, object picking, etc.

  * misc - Miscellaneous examples.  Some demos for loading and working
    with record arrays.

  * mplot3d - 3D examples.

  * pylab_examples - The interface to Matplotlib similar to MATLAB.

  * tests - Tests used by Matplotlib developers to check functionality.
    (These tests are still sometimes useful, but mostly developers should
    use the pytest tests which perform automatic image comparison.)

  * units - Working with unit data and custom types in Matplotlib.

  * user_interfaces - Using Matplotlib in a GUI application, e.g.,
    Tkinter, wxPython, PyGObject, PyQt widgets.

  * widgets - Examples using interactive widgets.
