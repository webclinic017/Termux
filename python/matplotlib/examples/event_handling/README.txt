Event handling
==============

Matplotlib supports :doc:`event handling</users/event_handling>` with a GUI
neutral event model, so you can connect to Matplotlib events without knowledge
of what user interface Matplotlib will ultimately be plugged in to.  This has
two advantages: the code you write will be more portable, and Matplotlib events
are aware of things like data coordinate space and which axes the event occurs
in so you don't have to mess with low level transformation details to go from
canvas space to data space.  Object picking examples are also included.
