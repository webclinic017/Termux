Third party packages
********************

Several external packages that extend or build on Matplotlib functionality are
listed below.  They are maintained and distributed separately from Matplotlib
and thus need to be installed individually.

Please submit an issue or pull request on GitHub if you have created
a package that you would like to have included.  We are also happy to
host third party packages within the `Matplotlib GitHub Organization
<https://github.com/matplotlib>`_.

Mapping toolkits
****************

Basemap
=======
`Basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/>`_ plots data on map projections,

Cartopy
=======
`Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ builds on top
of Matplotlib to provide object oriented map projection definitions
and close integration with Shapely for powerful yet easy-to-use vector
data processing tools. An example plot from the `Cartopy gallery

holoviews
=========
`holoviews <http://holoviews.org>`_ makes it easier to visualize data
interactively, especially in a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org>`_, by
providing a set of declarative plotting objects that store your data and
associated metadata.  Your data is then immediately visualizable alongside or
overlaid with other data, either statically or with automatically provided
widgets for parameter exploration.

points and the plotting (excluding reading in the data) took less than a
second on an average laptop:

called WCSAxes (available at `astropy.visualization.wcsaxes
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/wcsaxes/index.html>`_) which
adds Matplotlib projections for Astronomical image data. The following is an
example of a plot made with WCSAxes which includes the original coordinate
system of the image and an overlay of a different coordinate system:
