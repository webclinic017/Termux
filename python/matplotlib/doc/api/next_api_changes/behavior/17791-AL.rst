GTK/Tk key name changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The handling of non-ASCII keypresses (as reported in the KeyEvent passed to
``key_press_event``-handlers) in the GTK and Tk backends now correctly reports
Unicode characters (e.g., â‚¬), and better respects NumLock on the numpad.

The following key names have changed; the new names are consistent with those
reported by the Qt backends:

- The "Break/Pause" key (keysym 0xff13) is now reported as "pause" instead of
  "break" (this is also consistent with the X key name).
- The numpad "delete" key is now reported as "delete" instead of "dec".
