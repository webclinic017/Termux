Widgets use ``CallbackRegistry`` to save callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`.Widget`\s with event observers now use a `.CallbackRegistry` for storing
callbacks. This is consistent with canvas event callbacks, and fixes some bugs
in widget callback handling.

Due to this change, callback methods are now stored as weak references, which
means you must keep a reference to the associated object. Otherwise it may be
garbage collected.
