``Colormap.set_extremes`` and ``Colormap.with_extremes``
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Because the `.Colormap.set_bad`, `.Colormap.set_under` and `.Colormap.set_over`
methods modify the colormap in place, the user must be careful to first make a
copy of the colormap if setting the extreme colors e.g. for a builtin colormap.

The new ``Colormap.with_extremes(bad=..., under=..., over=...)`` can be used to
first copy the colormap and set the extreme colors on that copy.

The new `.Colormap.set_extremes` method is provided for API symmetry with
`.Colormap.with_extremes`, but note that it suffers from the same issue as the
earlier individual setters.
