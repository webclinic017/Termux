This file provides general patch-file install and upgrade notes, and logs files changed in the latest releases.


GENERAL NOTES ON CHANGES
------------------------

  For more details on changes made, see the changed code files here, 
  as well as their programs' "Usage Notes" section in the main guide:

    https://learning-python.com/using-tkinter-programs-on-android.html
 
  As a rule, the latest version of a patched source-code file contains 
  all changes to date, and every file includes an Android preamble that 
  documents recent-changes' purpose and date for every release in which 
  it was changed; also check these periodically for programs you use.
  Search for "# ANDROID" in patched files to see each change's code.


HOW TO USE CHANGED FILES
------------------------

  If installing for the first time, simply follow the guide's instructions
  to copy the patched files here into your unzipped program folders.  See
  each programs' "Running the Program" section for full install directions.
  You can fetch the patched files from this folder or its "ALL*" zip file, 
  or via the "save" link in online code-viewer pages.

  If upgrading, recopy the changed files listed below into program folders.
  If you've made changes to a configurations file (e.g., frigcal_configs.py),
  be sure to save and re-add them to the new version.

  Caution: when upgrading to a new version of a changed file, copies in some 
  Android file explorers may store the new version alongside the old with a 
  "_1" name pattern, which means it will not be used by the program; remove 
  prior versions manually if needed, or move instead of copying.  This may 
  be an issue if you don't get a file-explorer "overwrite" warning on copies.


CHANGES LOG: LATEST FIRST
-------------------------

SOURCE-CODE FILES CHANGED, SEP-16-2020

  PyGadgets' PyToe:
    -tictactoe_lists.py (new file: for Python 3.8, use time.perf_counter if no time.clock)

  Mergeall:
    -mergeall_configs.py (docs only: add a comment about using DPI settings for fit)

  This update reflects new usage on Android 10, Pydroid 3 4.0, and Python 3.8.
  The first file is new in this release, and is a required install for PyToe.
  While code changes are minor, the usage guide doc was substantially revised.

SOURCE-CODE FILES CHANGED, APR-21-2019

  PyEdit:
    -textEditor.py (work around Pydroid 3 3.0 webbrowser bugs: Help + Run Code)

  Mergeall:
    -launch-mergeall-GUI.pyw (work around Pydroid 3 3.0 webbrowser bugs: Help + logfiles)

  Frigcal 
    - frigcal.py (work around Pydroid 3 3.0 webbrowser bugs: Help)

  Frigcal's and PyGadgets' launcher scripts were also modified for the same 
  help workarounds but are not fully operational, and need not be reinstalled.
  PyGadgets' launcher now also works around Pydroid 3's button color-loss bug.
    - frigcal-launcher.pyw
    - PyGadgets.py

  The _openbrowser.py and _whichpy.py demo scripts were also updated, but
  are not required to run application programs.


----

SOURCE-CODE FILES CHANGED, APR-19-2019

  PyEdit:
    -textEditor.py (handle Pydroid 3 3.0's new Python path in Run Code)

  Mergeall:
    -launch-mergeall-GUI.pyw (handle Pydroid 3 3.0's new Python path in merge spawn)
    -mergeall_configs.py     (logfile documentation change only: optional reinstall)

  The following file was also changed (to use webbrowser), but its 
  changes did not alter behavior, and it need not be reinstalled:
    - frigcal.py

  Frigcal's and PyGadgets' launcher scripts were also modified, 
  but are not fully operational, and need not be reinstalled:
    - frigcal-launcher.pyw
    - PyGadgets.py

  PyCalc also opens its "hist" history display a few characters wider
  for ease of use (and small phones have room), but this is trivial:
    - calculator.py

  Only the first two files in the above set are required reinstalls; they 
  work around changes in the latest version of the Pydroid 3 app.

  Other: new in this release are _openbrowser.py which demos web-browser 
  opening techniques, and _whichpy.py that demos sys.executable work-around
  techniques; _font-tests-pydroid3.py was updated with new information.
  These three files are never required to run application programs.

SOURCE-CODE FILES CHANGED, APR-12-2019

  Frigcal:
    -frigcal.py
    -frigcal_configs.py

  PyCalc:
    -calculator.py
    -helpmessage.py

  PyEdit:
    -textEditor.py

  Mergeall:
    -launch-mergeall-GUI.pyw

  PyPhoto, PyClock, PyToe: 
    - also use the new helpmessage.py

  All have multiple improvements, and are strongly suggested reinstalls.
