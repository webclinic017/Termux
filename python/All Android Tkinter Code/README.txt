This folder has changed source code files to copy into your
various unzipped source-code packages, per the instructions 
in the guide here:

  http://learning-python.com/using-tkinter-programs-on-android.html

Also included is _android_test.py to simplify platform testing
in code that must vary on Android (e.g., font configs), and 
other test programs named with a leading "_" character.

File ALL-ANDROID-TKINTER-CODE.zip contains all the files here,
for copying to your phone in a single step.

SEE ALSO: file _changes-and-upgrades.txt here includes a list of 
code files recently changed, and extra install/upgrade instructions.

About Mergeall file copies:

  The changed Mergeall files in this folder:

    launch-mergeall-GUI.pyw
    mergeall_configs.py

  are redundant copies of those in the Mergeall package here:

    https://learning-python.com/mergeall-android-scripts/

  See that package's documentation for more details at:

    https://learning-python.com/mergeall-android-scripts/_README.html#toc83

  Some screenshots in .. are copied from the Mergeall package too;
  redundancy is a bad idea in general, but it's a convenience here.
