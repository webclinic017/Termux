# ANDROID version, Jan-Apr 2019 (search for "# ANDROID" to view all changes).
# These changes may be merged into the original code in a later release.
#
# Recent changes (search for [date] labels to see changes made):
#
# [Apr2119] Pydroid 3 3.0 broke webbrowser: use os.system(cmd) with a 
#           hardcoded Android activity-manager command line instead
#           (3.0's $DISPLAY breaks module, $BROWSER kills "file://").
#
# [Apr1919] Fix the Run-Code "Capture" workaround to the Pydroid 3 empty 
#           sys.executable bug, to accommodate the different Python path 
#           in Pydroid 3's 3.0.  The fix now reads a spawned 'which python' 
#           command to be path agnostic when hardcoding the Python path.
#           Also revert to using webbrowser for Help's user guide: it does 
#           work, but iff files use '"file://" and HTML docs use online URLs
#           (but Run-Code "Click" still uses os.system); see _openbrowser.py.
#
# [Apr1219] Reenable Help's "User Guide" button, and fix it to open with an
#           os.system() spawn of an activity-manager command instead of Py's
#           webbrowser; open online version of help, for its latest changes.
#           Also: shrink help dialog; work around its About/Versions truncated
#           text with custom scrolled-text dialogs using word wrap and sized 
#           for fit; and open default apps on Android for Run-Code's "Click".
#
# [Mar3119] An attempt to manually line-break some help-dialog text was
#           abandoned because it's impossible to get the fit right for both
#           orientations.  Pydroid 3 tkinter truncates instead of wrapping.
#
# [Mar2819] New user config for initial folder of Open/Save file-chooser dialog;
#           else, navigating to user content can be tedious in the Tk dialog.
#           Also trim some comments lines: Pydroid 3 can't handle larger files.
#
# [Feb2019] Clarify Android Tk font constraints in preset fonts pick list.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the Tk text widget, plus GuiMaker menus and toolbar buttons, to implement
a full-featured text editor and code laucher that can be run as a standalone
program, and attached as a library component to other GUIs.  Also used by the
PyMailGUI and PyView programs to edit mail text and image-file notes, and by 
PyMailGUI and PyDemos in pop-up mode to display source and text files.

PROGRAM USE: 
  Run this main script (by click, command-line, IDLE Run option, etc.) to 
  start PyEdit, either with no arguments to open files in the GUI, or with one
  argument giving the pathname of a file to be opened and loaded initially:

      [[py]thon] textEditor.py [filename]

  Edit file textConfig.py to customize PyEdit appearance and behavior.  Some
  status messages are printed to the console, if PyEdit is started from one.
  You can also run this script in PyEdit's Run Code, once PyEdit is started.

LIBRARY USE:
  PyEdit can also be imported and used by other programs as GUI component
  or popup display; see its top-level classes near the end of this module. 

DISTRIBUTIONS:
  As of version 3.0, PyEdit is available both as this source, and as a frozen
  app or executable on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  The latter support opens by 
  associations, and require no Python install.  The source-code version is 
  also shipped as part of PyMailGUI 4.0.  See README.txt for more details.

TEXT POLICIES:
  PyEdit opens and saves files using a Unicode encoding that you may input
  or hardcode (see textConfig.py); reads files having any end-line format;
  and saves files using the hosting platform's end-line format (see utility
  fixeoln.py in tools/ if you need to change end-lines in a saved file).

# Android: ***ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION TRIMMED HERE***
# Because Pydroid 3's IDE editor cannot handle source files > roughly 256k 
# bytes (and lets the user's program die without warning!), some additional 
# comments were deleted here.  See this file's original version for text cut,
# and learning-python.com/mergeall-android-scripts/_README.html#toc85.

"""
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.0] General and initial Mac OS X porting notes:

PyEdit's menu items automatically show up in the top-of-screen menu bar on Mac
(as normal and expected).  Some dialog titles were tweaked here for the Mac.
Mac dialogs can also be slide-downs (via parent=win) but are not here, because
using popup windows in a multiwindow interface seems more flexible and natural.
UPDATE: parent=self is now used on Mac too, else root is lifted above subject.

Alt+<underline> menu keyboard shortcuts don't work on Mac - likely need to also
support "accelerator" options and bindings in GuiMaker.  As is, menus can be
navigated by keyboard on  Mac (ctrl+fn+F2, letter1, space, letter1), but it's
cumbersome; for now, added Undo and Redo to all toolbars for easier access.
UPDATE: menu accelerators _have_ been added, and tailored to the Mac's keys.

Mac menus remain always active and can reopen an already-open modal dialog,
which can cause havoc.  This seems paridigm skew, but duplicate modal actions
are disabled here via a decorator to avoid the issue altogether.  Mac menus also
don't have Tk tearoffs - between this and lack of Alt+* shortcuts, they seem
a bit less useful.  Mac menus also add some items "for free" that need to be
replaced (e.g., About), and have inheritance issues that may be Tk 8.5 specific.

tkinter dialog window-border patches

[3.0] The following extends two classes in the tkinter module to add custom
icons to the standard modal dialogs askstring() and askinteger().  Unlike
most common dialogs, these two always display the default Tk icon without the
code below (even if a parent is specified), and have no icon protocol support
themselves.  Caveat: these classes are semi-private ("_"), and open to future
changes that may break this code (really, hack, but there's no alternative).

Caveat: askcolor() displays no icon (even if a parent/master is passed in),
and seems unable to be patched to use a custom icon (there is no Toplevel to
use in an extended method).  This is less grievous than other ask*(): punt!

Caveat: the SaveAs dialog also posts a dialog without title or icon when the
user selects an existing file (an overwrite warning).  There seems no way to
improve this, as it's issued by Tk's common dialogs internally: also punt!
UPDATE: actually, for this the Mac app shows a slidedown with a small version 
of the PyEdit icon, along with the warning symbol imgage - this seems fine;

More tkinter dialog patches: pass parent arg (but allow for omission on Mac)

[3.0] Tk's common dialogs on Windows lift the root window above the subject
window when they differ, unless a parent=self argument is included.  On Mac,
this is not the case for simple dialogs like showinfo, but is for others.
This is also done for Open/Save dialogs, still coded as instance methods ahead.

On Mac, parent=self unfortunately(?) also invokes slide-down sheet style instead
of a popup window, and discards the dialog's window title, which may or may not
be preferred - hence the encapsulation here for possible future changes.
Caveat: these perhaps should be methods, but this grew from a simple fix.

Note that passing a "master=self" argument has no effect on root window lifts,
and askstring/askinteger still popup in a window (but now don't raise the root).
While we're at it, also add appname to title automatically here (not per call),
and restore parent focus botched by most dialogs in ActiveState Tk 8.5 on Mac.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    [3.0] THE TALE OF THE GREP-THREAD CRASH WORKAROUNDS...
    
    TAKE 1: speculative recodings
    
    This code occasionally crashed due to a threading bug in the
    combination of Python 3.5 and Tk 8.6 (at least), described here:
    learning-python.com/books/python-changes-2014-plus.html#s35E.

    As possible fixes, this was recoded to (1) avoid any possible
    uncaught exceptions in the non-GUI thread, and (2) explicitly
    close input files, though no evidence has ever been found to
    support either theory, and neither should have resulted in a
    hard crash (at best, these may have triggered an unrelated bug).

    The GUI consumer code (in the main class) was also recoded to
    (3) sanitize and truncate result list inserts, but this proved
    irrelevant - the crashes occur before results are pulled from
    the queue.  In the end, NONE of these three recodings were seen
    to have fixed the Tk crash (yes, argh); maybe Tk 8.7 or 8.5 will...
    
    TAKE 2: use processes instead of threads (despite the name)

    The prime suspect now appears to be Python's threading module,
    because Python's more basic _thread module is used extensively in
    the PyMailGUI program without any issues.  Hence, the grep spawn
    code has now been recoded to experiment with all the alternatives:
    threading and _thread's threads, and multiprocessing's processes.
    The latter is used by default (this can be set in textConfig.py). 

    multiprocessing has some downsides:
    - It necessitated moving the parallel task's code here (it requires
      a pickleable callable - a top-level function, or an instance of a
      top-level subclass with run()).
    - It is broken for frozen single-file executable programs (pickle
      imports fail), and required a workaround patch for this context.
      See multiprocessing_exe_patch.py and __main__ for more details.
    - It may startup more slowly (it spawns a new python program on
      Windows and forks a new process on Unix)
    - It cannot do freely-shared state quite like threads (e.g., it
      can't pass object method callables).

    OTOH, multiprocessing sidesteps thread issues completely, and
    runs *faster* where it can leverage multiple CPU cores.  On one
    multicore Windows test machine, N grep processes may run N times
    faster than threads (each gets as much CPU as a single threaded
    process), and the story is similar on Mac OS X (processes can
    consume more CPU time than threads, and finish noticably quicker).

    In addition, state is a moot point here (grep queues just a list
    of strings, not PyMailGUI's callables), and this code can easily
    revert to using threads in the future, because multiprocessing
    exports largely-compatible interfaces.

    Plus, multiprocessing works around the Tk and/or Python thread
    crash.  Such is development in the world of battery dependency.
    
    UPDATE AND CAVEAT: per later usage, it appears that Python 3.5's
    libs can still hard-crash (segfault) on very rare occasions while 
    reading a next line in some UTF-8 files (sigsegv on Mac, at least).
    This may or may not be related to the original crash, and may or 
    may not be triggered by a specific file's unusual content.  It's 
    also a dead end for this program; is it fixed in later Pythons?
    Either way, using processes is warranted by improved speed alone.

Version â %s, June 2017 (Android 2019)

A text-editor and code-launcher program and component.
PyEdit is open source, uses Python 3.X and its tkinter
GUI toolkit, and runs on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux,
and Android.

Author and Â© M. Lutz 2000-2019. Originally from
the book "Programming Python, 4th Edition" (a.k.a. PP4E),
published by O'Reilly Media, Inc.

For quick access to menu actions, use the toolbar,
accelerator-key shortcuts, and menu tear-offs and
Alt-underline shortcuts where supported. For help
with dialogs, see their Help buttons. For in-depth
usage details and license, see UserGuide.html.

PyEdit Version History

â %s: Jan, 2019 (Android)
â %s: Jun, 2017 (PCs)
â 2.1: Apr, 2010
â 2.0: Jan, 2006
â 1.0: Oct, 2000

â Version %s was released with Android patches
in January 2019, initially.

â Version %s adds
custom icons,
non-BMP Unicode replacements,
font- and color-list configs,
dialog help and keys,
color cycling,
auto-saves,
grep search stats,
colored cursors,
menu accelerator keys,
font zoom,
line wrap modes,
toolbar fonts,
already-open checks,
case toggles for searches,
parallel grep processes,
run-code dialog and stream capture,
exe and app bundle distributions,
and full utility on Mac OS X
in addition to Windows and Linux.

â Version 2.1 was released with PP4E. It addded
Python 3.X code,
a "grep" external-files search dialog,
verified quits if any edit windows' text is changed,
arbitrary Unicode encodings for files,
support for multiple change and font dialogs,
and upgrades to the run-code option.

â Versions 2.0 and 1.0 appeared in PP3E and PP2E.
1.0 introduced core utility, and 2.0 added
a font-pick dialog,
unlimited undo/redo,
smarter save prompting only if text changed,
case-insensitive search,
and configuration module textConfig.py."""

        Coded as an instance method, so actions have access to a self.
        Underlines: [Alt+<menuchar1>,<key>] shortcuts on Windows/Linux.
        
        [3.0] Added menu accelerator keys; these are in addition to the
        Alt-key underline shortcuts on Windows and Linux, but underlines
        don't work on the Mac, and its menu is farther away at screen top.
        Underlines also fail on Windows/Linux in embedded Frame menus,
        and are no longer displayed in this context.
        
        Most of the magic here occurs in utility ../Tools/guimaker.py.
        In accelerators, '*'/'?' stand for platform-specific keys (e.g.,
        '*' is Command on Mac and displays as an icon; it means Control
        on Windows/Linux and displays as 'Ctrl+').  More details ahead.
        
        [3.0] Note that some menu/toolbar options handled explictly here
        also have preset Text-widget binding equivalents with automatic
        actions (e.g., ctrl|cmd-c/v for copy/paste, ctrl|cmd-z for undo),
        which are disabled by the same-key accelerators specified here.
        The built-ins update the widget's changed flag and undo stacks.

        [3.0] Reorganized menus and their underline shortcut keys to
        highlight most commonly used, and added a few more separators.
        Also reorganized and expanded the toolbar, and allow its layout
        style and font to be configured in textConfig.py; use the space.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        [3.0] If configured to do so, every 5 minutes (by default) save a
        copy of the current text in every open, changed, and unsaved PyEdit
        window or widget, to the configured self-cleaning auto-save folder.

        Usage notes:
        -- By design, this DOES NOT overwrite actual files being edited,
           but saves copies in a dedicated, separate folder.  It's just a
           last-resort backup in case of outright crash or operator mistake.
           Saved files will generally be useful immediately, or not at all.
        -- Cleans up auto-save files more than one week old (by default)
           to minimize clutter/space in the save dir
        -- Auto-save applies to both top-level (main and popup) windows, and
           embedded components in client program windoes (e.g., PyMailGUI
           View/Write mail text).  All PyEdit window types are auto-saved.
        -- Time between runs and retention days are now configurable, but
           their defaults are reasonable: 5 mins is roughly just 1 paragraph,
           and catastrophic data loss is likely known immediately or soon  
        -- To disable folder cleaning but leave auto-save enabled, set the
           days-retained to a very high number (but these files are temps);
           to disable auto-saves set its folder to None.

        Coding notes:
        -- Uses either a known filename, or one generated for still-nameless
           windows.  In the former, the pathname (as much of it as possible)
           is appended to the filename to make same-named files unique in the
           auto-save folder, whether edited in the same or different sessions.
           In the latter, a window counter makes names unique in a session,
           and a process id makes them unique across sessions
        -- Uses general UTF-8 Unicode because a desired Unicode encoding
           may not yet be known or appropriate
        -- Runs just 1 auto-save timer loop per process, shared by any
           number of open windows in the session
        -- Tk's widget.after() method requires that widget not be destroyed
           before the timer expires, else no callback occurs (for proof, see
           docetc/examples/demo-poll-silent-exit-on-window-close.py)  Since
           "self" may be temporary (e.g., PyMailGUI components or popups), use
           tkinter._default_root, the implicit or explicit first-created Tk()
           that endures for the program, but fallback on "self" if it's None
           or unset ("self" is saved by tkinter callback even if its window
           is destroyed, so it can be used both for the timer handler and the
           after() widget).  See tkinter.NoDefaultRoot() for more on this story.
           This may preclude an all peer-level Tk() model: one window must be
           long-lived, and a "welcome" Tk() might open on every click on some.
        -- The ascii() calls for print() in announce() avoid exceptions when
           printing filenames with emojis on Mac OS X with no console (really)
        -- All Pyedit windows are automatically registered for auto-save on
           creation, and deregistered in their Text widgets' <Destroy> handler;
           registry is implemented as a simple global (class-level) list.
        -- Assumes CWD not changed if the save-path is relative to '.' (and
           the default is); now true, but Run Code's String mode made it iffy.
        -- TBD: this could be threaded if it ever becomes a noticable pause;
           unless you're running on a floppy drive, it's probably fine...

            same-named files located at different paths distinct.

        tests if file is okay ahead of time to try to avoid opens;
        this code could also load and manually decode bytes to str to
        avoid multiple open attempts (like Save ahead), but it is
        unlikely that this code will wind up trying all its cases;

        encoding behavior is configurable in the local textConfig.py:
        1) tries known type first if passed in by client (email charsets)
        2) if opensAskUser True, try user input next (prefill wih defaults)
        3) if opensEncoding nonempty, try this encoding next: 'latin-1', etc.
        4) tries sys.getdefaultencoding() platform default next
        5) uses binary mode bytes and Tk policy as the last resort

        end-lines: because the 'newline' parameter is not passed to open(),
        this code is able to read files having any end-line format (DOS \r\n
        or Unix \n), and receives its read results in universal \n format
        in text mode 'r' (binary-mode reads do not translate end-lines);

        file closes: as coded, this relies on the fact that CPython file 
        objects automatically close() themselves when garbage collected, 
        which happens here when expression temporaries are discarded;

        [3.0] add already-open test/raise, and return True if and only if
        a file was opened (else None) to avoid a bad line# error in Grep;

        [3.0] warn the user about replacements and destructive saves if the
        file content has non-BMP "emoji" chracters; Tk ~8.6 doesn't support;

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        [3.0] On Run in RunCode dialog: launch this window's text as code.  
        Run as clicked program, spawned process with or without console, 
        or spawned process with standard streams (console IO) capture.
        
        The latter--Capture mode--is preferred.  It uses a reader thread with
        an after() timer output-polling loop to avoid blocking the GUI, and 
        each run gets its own popup whose close will kill the code if running.
        This isn't the sole mode, because scrolling is slow on Macs in the Tk
        used for development, and Click mode has valid use cases (e.g., HTML).  
        See the the onRunCode() GUI builder above for additional details.

        Subtlety: the PyEdit launcher script "Launch_PyEdit.pyw" shipped
        with PyMailGUI uses a wait() call to stay open until PyEdit exits.
        This is required to keep PyEdit's streams usable for any code PyEdit
        runs here.  Else, the code's grandparent (launcher) stdin stream
        reports EOFError (or OSError) immediately in terminals on Unix, for
        code using input in modes String, Streamless, and Console.  This is
        not an issue for Capture mode which works without wait() too (yet
        another reason to prefer it), or when textEditor.py is run directly,
        though closing PyMailGUI's launcher can trigger the issue too (rare!). 

        Update: the original string mode ("String" in this version) has been
        withdrawn from the GUI.  It leads to issues when the GUI is unblocked
        while code runs, and can cause PyEdit to be closed without save prompts
        if the code spawned is either a GUI that quits or any code that exits.  
        Generally, spawned code must be run in a separate process to insulate 
        PyEdit from the code's errors and exits; the three remaining Run Code
        modes do so, at the minor expense of requiring code to be saved in files.
        Most of String mode's original code was moved to a doc file: see ahead.
        A prior Streamless mode has also been cut; use Console on Windows.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        About the input() replacements:

        [See also above: String mode has now been withdrawn.  Capture modes uses
        a proxy script; it was originally designed to replace the built-in input()
        with a version that flushes its prompt as described here, but has since
        grown to perform additional tasks; see notes ahead at Capture mode's code.]

        1) String mode requires an input() replacement, because the builtin
        version releases control to the GUI while waiting for input.  This 
        has to do with Python's input hook function (PyOS_InputHook), which
        oddly is coded to trigger Tk's event loop too when tkinter is used.
        The net effect is that Tk Guis are normally blocked for paused or 
        long-running actions--but NOT for an input() that is waiting for text.
      
        This isn't a concern for sys.stdin.realine() (which is blocking) or 
        other run modes (which run in separate processes).  It matters for 
        String mode, because the CWD is reset while the target code runs.
        This can make auto-save misroute CWD-based save files if its after() 
        events can fire during a paused input(), and can break Help's image
        and HTML paths if its button remains active.  To fix, we could either
        save directories at start-up instead of fetching as needed, or replace
        the built-in input() with one that is blocking; the latter was used.

        Note that this is not an issue for sys.stdin.readline() calls in code
        run by String mode: the GUI is blocked until input is entered in the 
        console--as normal.  Also note that all other Run Code run modes are 
        immune to this issue, because they run code in a separate process (and
        are probably preferred for that reason; String mode is a legacy tool).

        2) Capture mode also defines a custom input() replacement, via code in 
        file subprocproxy.py.  This replacement is not to force blocking, but 
        is required to force input() to flush its prompt with a newline before 
        reading; else prompts would appear _after_ user input is required.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        About the (*now withdrawn*) String mode:
        
        1) On further testing, input() redefinition does _not suffice to keep 
        the GUI blocked in all cases.  This is true even if the custom version
        is injected into the builtin scope.  The source of the GUI event-loop
        restart may be any, but GUI code that runs a nested mainloop() call 
        suffices to wreak havoc.  Hence, String mode is prone to odd behavior 
        when it should wait for the run code to exit but does not.  This 
        merits a punt for now; other modes are recommended.

        2) String mode code also uses PyEdit's GUI event loop and root widget.
        Building more widgets may add to PyEdit's root, and a widgets.quit()
        may shut down PyEdit (without a prompt for unsaved changes!).  Don't
        do this.  String mode, if used at all, should be for non-GUI programs.
        [String mode was later withdrawn for this reason: it's too dangerous.]
        
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Console mode alternatives

        In Console mode, explored starting new console/terminal windows in this
        mode on _all_ platforms, and _never_ if all 3 standard streams are TTYs
        (if their .isatty() is True).  It seems overkill to open a new console
        window on Windows with Start if one is already present, and the code's
        streams are inoperative on Unix in this mode when no terminal exists.

        This was abandoned, because it makes for behavior that seems uneven
        (a new console might appear or not, depending on how PyEdit was run),
        and there seems no usable way to open a new terminal on Unix to run a
        Python script with command-line arguments, leaving this per-platform.
        "open -a Terminal stuff.py" is almost there on Mac, but script cmd args
        fail; "gnome-terminal" may work on some Linux, but may not work on all.
        Capture mode works the same and everywhere => it's the recommended mode.

        Console mode could also fallback on using Capture-like Popen calls but
        not catpuring streams, but this was deemed moot: use Capture mode if
        there is no Python executable present or configured.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Frozen app and executable notes
        
        Frozen apps/executables throw a monkey-wrench into the RunCode design,
        because they ship with a fixed set of frozen library models (for both
        Mac apps and Windows/Linux exes), and may ship with no Python executable
        at all (for Windows/Linux exes).  Moreover, one of the features of
        frozen programs the that they never require a separate Python install.
        Requiring a Python install may be reasonable for running code, but it's
        a bit much for casual users.  How to run arbitrary user Python code?

        This was resolved by forced-inclusion of all (or most?) standard libs
        in the freezes for basic use, and allowing the textConfig.py file to 
        specify both a Python executable when one is preferred or required, and
        import-path settings to pick up different or locally-installed items.

        For exes on Windows and Linux, the Capture mode's proxy script also
        must be frozen, because there may be no standalone Python executable.
        In this case only, a Python executable _must_ be configured for modes
        that require one for running user code -- namely, Console mode only.
        For capture mode, _both_ the .py and frozen versions of the proxy are
        shipped: the former is used when textConfig.py names an installed
        Python, and the (more limited) frozen proxy is used otherwise.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Killing spawned scripts: 

        As a new feature, Capture now forcibly kills spawned programs when 
        their run window is closed by the user so the programs don't live on
        indefinitely.  This is important when the program is waiting on input
        from PyEdit, but is especially useful for code stuck in an infinite loop.
        It's also platform-specific and complex.  This is especially so when 
        using subprocess's shell=True (a kill may kill the shell parent, not its 
        proxy-command child), but this setting is required for other reasons here 
        (e.g., allowing arbitrary command-line args without parsing).

        On Mac:
           Popen's kill() does the trick, without manually-formed process groups.

        On Windows:
           Kills require running a "taskkill /f /t" command to force-kill the
           shell process by its pid, and all processes it started (including the
           proxy).  Setting shell=False with a cmd string sufficed in some 
           contexts but not all (e.g., frozen Windows executables), and the Popen
           CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP is not required to make this work.

           taskkill causes momentary console popups in frozen Windows PyEdits only,
           unless this command is run with subprocess.Popen() and shell=True as
           done here.  This forces use of STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW and SW_HIDE; passing
           Popen creationflags=CREATE_NO_WINDOWS (0x08000000) may work too (untried).
           os.system() did popups; os.popen() broke kills; os.spawnv() was untried.
           
           Windows process groups may be a cleaner solution for kills (and are
           used for Linux), but did not work at all despite multiple tries for the
           use case here - a stack that may include python, subprocess, cmd.exe,
           and Windows APIs, and can go bad anyhere along the way.

        On Linux:
           Kills require special code to create a process group at launch and 
           kill the entire group on window close, else only the shell is killed,
           not the proxy child it launches.  Using an "exec " cmd prefix to 
           replace the shell with its child also works, but only for source-code
           proxies (not frozen).  Neither of these are required on Mac, for 
           reasons that remain a suggested exercise (automatic groups?)
              
        A portable and alternative (but unverified) fix requires the 3rd-party
        psutil package to walk and kill child processes, and was not used here.
        Windows and Linux frozen PyInstaller proxies additionally must arrange
        for pruning of their temporary folders on non-normal exit; see ahead.
 
        In the end, Python's subprocess module is really two very-different
        and platform-specific interfaces.  While it helps with stream captures,
        it also adds an extra layer of wrapper code which may obscure platform
        interfaces too much, and is hardly a replacement for all prior art. 

        UPDATE: still-running spawned programs also have to be killed when 
        PyEdit closes, or they die horrible SIGPIPE deaths; see onCloseWindow.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Prior version comments follow (most are still relevant):
        
        run Python code being edited--not an IDE, but handy;
        tries to run in file's dir, not cwd (may be PP4E root);
        inputs and adds command-line arguments for script files;

        code's stdin/out/err = editor's start window, if any:
        run with a console window to see code's print outputs;
        but parallelmode uses Start to open a DOS box for I/O;
        module search path will include '.' dir where started;
        in non-file mode, code's Tk root may be PyEdit's window;
        subprocess or multiprocessing modules may work here too;

        2.1: fixed to use base file name after chdir, not path;
        2.1: use StartArgs to allow args in file mode on Windows;
        2.1: run an update() after 1st dialog else 2nd dialog 
        sometimes does not appear in rare cases (at this writing);

        [3.0] notes: launchmodes adds sys.executable py to cmdline
        in filemode launches; its objects' args are label+cmdline;        
        verified on Mac OS X - run from Terminal to see prints;

            # program (e.g., PyMailGUI), except for source-code distributions.
            # Instead, we issue a message pointing users to the full PyEdit 
            # download site.  This is largely due to implementation issues (it
            # seems odd to bake all stdlibs into an email client for a coding 
            # tool), but also for security (mixing code and email is a bad
            # idea).  Capture works fully in all _PyEdit_ standalone packages
            # (source, app, exes) as well as source-code form PyMailGUIs, but 
            # has minimal stdlibs/utility in PyMailGUI frozen app and exes.
            #
            # TBD TEMP: we could allow Run Code if the user has configured a 
            # Python exe; this may run into PYTHONPATH/HOME issues in PyMailGUI
            # app, and seems a bit too tricky for a rarely-used feature.
            #
            # FINAL POLICY: we now disable Run Code and issue a popup when 
            # PyEdit is an imported embedded component, in **all** run modes: 
            # source, frozen app, frozen exe.  Although Run Code works in 
            # source-code PyMailGUIs, and has only reduced stdlib support in
            # the Mac app PyMailGUI, running code in other programs like email
            # clients seems largely academic, if not invalid.  The last straw

            # would add an extra exit task to embedders (along the lines of

    def onHelp(self):
        """
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        display my help text in a simple info dialog;  this could
        popup HTML via py's webbrowser module, but that seems overkill
        for PyEdit's intuitive actions;  caveat: showinfo() formats the
        text better on some platforms than others (Linux seems worst);
        this becomes "About" under "Help" on Mac and Linux because of
        GuiMaker's logic (Help content follows complex rules on Macs);

        [3.0] This now pops up a custom dialog that allows users to pick
        either About--the original showinfo text box, or User Guide--the
        new HTML doc auto-opened in a web browser.  Ideally, these would
        be separate menu entries, but the dialog is the easiest way to
        work with GuiMaker's Help logic unchanged (any more, at least).

        [3.0] Now splits up the original help text into two halves: About
        and Versions.  The combo was too long for an info box on Linux
        (and small screens?), and info boxes can't be adjusted.  Versions
        is still not short, but what would you expect from PP4E's author?

        [3.0] Subtle: the About and Versions info boxes are children of 
        the Help dialog (not self TextEditor) so Help gets active focus 
        on close.  This makes it only partly modal on Mac, but acceptably.

        [3.0] UPDATE: Yes, this is/was a Tk 8.5 bug, until at least
        late 2015: http://core.tcl.tk/tk/tktview/1739605.  The best 
        workaround is to either not call see() at all and assume that
        the view is at the top, or call Text.see() twice in succession
        as done here (see ../docetc's demo-tk-line1-scroll-bug.py for
        a minimal proof).  Later Tks may also help, but iff installed.
 
        Hence, callers *no longer must call update()* to fix the see()
        line #1 issue for just-packed PyEdit windows.  And they probably
        shouldn't - doing so can cause a visible flash even if windows
        withdraw() and deiconify() to hide during builds, and may even
        trigger an unrelated initial sizing bug in Tk 8.5 that ignores
        config() but is officially outside the scope of this docstring.

    Popup PyEdit top-level windows that destroy() to close only self on a Quit
    in the GUI, close with their parent (usually the app root), build a menu on
    a window, and do not check for changes in any other windows on close.
    onQuit is run for Quit in toolbar or File menu, as well as window border X,
    but not from application-menu or Dock Quit when run on Mac OS X.
    
    Makes and builds on new Toplevel window, which is itself a child to another
    parent - the root Tk (for None), an explicit Tk, or other passed-in window
    or widget.  Adds to edit-windows list so will be checked for changes if any
    PyEdit main window quits, and included in auto-saves.

    The new window's parent should generally be the program's Tk root (e.g., a
    main PyEdit window's parent - which is automatic if parent is None), so it
    won't be silently closed by a transient parent's closure while being tracked
    for changes or auto-saves.  This won't cause errors (<Destroy> events now
    update tracking lists), but any unsaved changes would be ignored on close.
    This is bad enough that a "note" is issued here if parent isn't a Tk; this
    is okay iff the client program has its own change tests (e.g., PyMailGUI),
    but not otherwse (e.g., Help initially made README popups dialog chldren).

    windows but are not themselves GuiMakerWindowMenu clients should also call
    guimaker.fixAppleMenuBar() with their app root window's help and quit info.

    its application menu's help and quit apply to the whole app as usual.

            at startup time) or new popup window(s) (all other receipts).

            OpenDoc events args can be > 1 if many selected and clicked
            as a group, and may come in here either just after the app
            is started, arbitrarily long after it's started, or never if
            the user clicks the app instead of a doc (Open/ReopenApp).
            This event has meaning only on Mac in frozen-app mode: for
            source code, the Python Launcher is the app, not this code.
            
            Open file in first (root) window if and only if event received 
            just after app start, else use popups with parent = Tk root so
            not auto closed with other Toplevels.  This code seems a wacky 
            heuristic, but is unavoidable: we don't want to open docs in a 
            formerly-opened root, but the user may have clicked _either_ 
            the app or a file initially, and only event-receipt time can 
            differentiate.  If PyEdit is embedded, the root is elsewhere 
            and PyEdit is not __main__, so this code is unused/irrelevant.
            
            Windows has no such requirement: either it or PyInstaller's
            bootstrap code spawns a new PyEdit process for each doc open,
            which is less functional (there is no shared state) but simple.
            Note: this is not called with no args if the app itself is
            clicked once it's already open (see the Reopen handler below).

            Also note that app startup sends either either OpenDoc if
            started via a file click or drop -XOR- OpenApp otherwise, and
            OpenDoc can be sent both at app startup and on later doc opens,
            whether the main window is in use or not.  Tk programs seem
            to register event handlers soon enough to catch either event,
            but don't use the main window for a doc _except_ at startup
            (even if user clears with File->New... and adds text or not).

            UPDATE: just like Grep matches, close a new popup window
            if the file is already open and the user opts to not reopen.
            This is debatable, but leaving an empty window under the auto
            raised window(s) where the file is already open seems odd: 
            it was usually closed manually anyhow, and a new popup can 
            always be made quickly on Macs with a new app/Dock click.

            NOTE: it's critical to _not_ open a filename in sys.argv[1]
            in app mode, as Finder/Launch Services may pass anything,
            including a '-psn_*' ProcessSerialNumber; use events instead,
            and ignore psn in argv (it is not also passed here);
                        
            NOTE: very rarely, this failed to open a first file in the 
            newly-launched app's main window for "Open With" (but not for 
            drag-and-drop); increased the delay time to 1.0 (not 0.5) to 
            compensate.  This has not been seen again, and may reflect a
            system or Tk bug, or have been a symptom of the prior note's 
            issue before it was fixed (TBD).

            SUBTLETY: this does an odd encode + decode to fix filenames 
            containing non-BMP Unicode emoji characters.  Either Tk or 
            Python's tkinter munge emojis such that os.path.isfile() in 
            onOpen() returns False, thereby causing such files to fail 
            for any Finder-based open (e.g., drag-and-drop).  Filenames
            are trashed when received here, but seem to contain encoded 
            bytes in a Python decoded str - which is why the encode/decode
            fixes all cases tested.  If this workaround ever fails, such 
            files can still be opened in PyEdit via a File->Open, per the
            popup; their name's emojis are replaced for display either way.
            Examples: docetc/examples/Assorted-demos/non-BMP-emoji-*.txt.
            Absolute pathnames received on this event look like this:
            '/.../Non-BMP-Emojis/Non-BMP-Emoji-both-\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a.txt'
