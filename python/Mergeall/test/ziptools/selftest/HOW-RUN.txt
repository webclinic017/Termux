Tests here reflect the automated output of selftest.py, and exercise the
basics of ziptools' symlink support.  See also cmdtest/ for more script
tests, and moretests/ for symlink, long pathname, and advanced tests.

To run tests here:

# ../../{test1, test2} were restored to their start state via test-1-2-do-unzip.py
# py3 was aliased to python3 on Mac, Linux results are the same as Mac (Unix)

/.../mergeall/test/ziptools$ py3 selftest.py > selftest/macosx-withcruft-output.txt
/.../mergeall/test/ziptools$ py3 selftest.py - > selftest/macosx-skipcruft-output.txt

C:\...\mergeall\test\ziptools> py -3 selftest.py > selftest\windows-withcruft-output.txt
C:\...\mergeall\test\ziptools> py -3 selftest.py - > selftest\windows-skipcruft-output.txt

# and Linux is identical to Mac OS X in this context

----
Expectations: the "withcruft" tests will show no differences in their mergeall and
diffall runs because they included the original folders' cruft.  The "skipcruft" 
tests will show differences, but only for cruft files skipped in the originals.

Results here were regenerated to reflect the final message order in zip-create/extract.
