Subject: ziptools - the bits that Python's zipfile forgot
----

Meet ziptools - all the features that you miss most in 
Python's zipfile module.  ziptools is both top-level 
scripts and importable modules that extend the standard
library's zipfile module for:

Folders: 	 
    it adds entire folder trees to zipfiles automatically

Modtimes:
    it propagates original modtimes for files, folders, and links

Cruft skips:
    it can either include or skip system "cruft" files on request

Symlinks:
    it copies or follows symlinks to files and dirs on Unix and Windows

Long paths:
    it supports long pathnames on Windows beyond its normal limits
