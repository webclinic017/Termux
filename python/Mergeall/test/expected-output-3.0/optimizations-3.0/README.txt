This folder records timing results of mergeall and
diffall coding optimizations attempted in version 3.0.
All tests here were run on Windows 7.

See the source code's docstrings for more details and
conclusions (search for "[3.0]" to find changes).  The 
"prior*" files here are pre-optimization versions, which 
may differ in additional ways by release.

For final comparison-phase timings, see the top-level's
docetc/miscnotes/3.0-mergeall-comparison-times.txt.
