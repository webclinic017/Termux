Updated: mergeall - Folder Synchronization for Manual "Clouds"

A new major release of mergeall has been posted.  This version's main 
upgrade is automatic backup of items replaced or deleted by the merge, 
so that changes can be backed out from any target device if needed.  
It also adds a more dynamic GUI, summary reports, a script workaround 
for FAT DST rollovers, and a new unzipped content copy on the web.
