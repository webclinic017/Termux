mergeall 2.1: automatic restores from automatic backups

mergeall is a directory tree synchronization system designed to offer a 
manual alternative to cloud storage.  Its latest release (yes, after just 
two weeks) builds on 2.0's automatic backup of changes, to add full rollback
of a prior run's modifications on demand.  This is a failsafe, meant to be 
used if you accidentally corrupt an archive copy so badly that piecemeal
restores won't help (unlikely, but bad things happen).  Details:
