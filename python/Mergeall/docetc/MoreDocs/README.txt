Supplemental documentation.  

Always read the top-level file "../../UserGuide.html" first.
It is the main user guide as of version 3.0, and is intended 
to subsume much of the older documention here.  The files here
are retained, however, as they include project and lower-level
details not covered again in the new user-oriented UserGuide.

Files here:

Revisions.html
    Chronicles changes made in each release.  Formerly known
    as "Readme.html" in the package's root folder.

Whitepaper.html
    Original usage guide, with extra background details on modes
    and features.  Formerly know as "Usage-Overview.html" here.

Lessons-Learned.html
    Older implementation notes from mergeall's first years.
