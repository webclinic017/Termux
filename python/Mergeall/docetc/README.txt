user guide, added in 3.0.  This folder has supplemental docs.

Major items here, in decreasing user-relevence order:

MoreDocs/Whitepaper.html
	is the original usage guide (extra background details)

MoreDocs/Revisions.html
	is the project's version history (changes per release)

MoreDocs/Lessons-Learned.html 
	is older implementation perspectives (for developers)

miscnotes/manual-commands-cheat.txt
	gives example command lines (paste your own here)

release-announcements/*
	has recent python-announce posts (a partial history)

Tools/*
	has scripts for color choice and line-end conversion (utilities)

launcher-configs/*
	has a Windows desktop icon, and launcher items (don't remove!)

docimgs/*
	is images used by the help documents (don't remove!)

For GUI screenshots, browse top-level /screenshots folder and open its
index.html, or read the Whitepaper's "Code, Docs, and Examples" section.
To conserve space, smoe screenshots referenced in MoreDocs files are 
maintained on the web, but are not included in the zipfile.
